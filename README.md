Project ideas, analysis and help
Starting a new project, working on myself to learn to code. An accident has caused me to need to change careers and I hope that for the better I can end up making a career out of coding. Hard work and dedication will be the driving factor and I hope to find a new project and career that is challenging and rewarding.
